                    <h4>Background story :</h4>
                    <p> In the months following the Battle at Gridiron, 
                        the IMS Hestia, with Anita and brother Jackson on board, 
                        was attacked by unknown assailants. A bomb on the outer hull 
                        blew out a chunk of the ship… but not before Jackson shielded her, 
                        sacrificing his own life to save hers. Anita watched helplessly, 
                        as Jackson was sucked out into the vacuum of space. 
                        After crashing on a Syndicate planet, Anita looked for both work, 
                        and the brother she refused to believe had died, so they could begin 
                        the decades-long trip back home. Now, she fights to raise money in the Adex Games, 
                        in the hopes of finding a pilot willing to take the epic trip back home to reunite 
                        with what remains of her family.</p>

                    <h4>Background story :</h4>
                    <p> The Adex Games didn’t change that, but they changed what it meant. 
                        Many of Gibraltar’s friends and colleagues have 
                        competed in the Games for extra money, fame, and glory over the years, 
                        and some never came home. Gibraltar joined to keep them safe and, for the first time, 
                        his skills as a rescuer and his rebellious nature worked together. He’s now become an 
                        icon in the Adex Games, putting himself in the line of fire to protect his squad and send 
                        his opponents running for cover.</p>

                    <h4>Background story :</h4>
                    <p> 
                    Since no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and 
                    every one of her victories means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging 
                    in the popular bloodsport. Or so she tells herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, 
                    but deep down she wants to help people and make the world a better place. If that means taking 
                    a few people down in the process, so be it.</p>

                    <h4>Background story :</h4>
                    <p> Bloodhound’s unparalleled tracking skills are a boon to any team they join, 
                        helping them root out hidden opponents and track enemy movements. 
                        Calling on Earth’s Old Norse Gods to guide them, Bloodhound believes that destiny 
                        is a path that has already been laid out, eventually carrying all to their death. 
                        But with that knowledge comes strength, because until that day comes, Bloodhound knows 
                        they can’t be stopped.</p>
