            <p>Born into a military family where she, her parents, and her four older 
            brothers all served with the IMC, Bangalore has been an exceptional soldier 
            her whole life. Dedicated to the IMC cause, she was top of her class at the 
            IMC Military Academy and the only cadet who could take apart a Peacekeeper, 
            equip it with a Precision Choke hop-up, and put it back together in under twenty seconds – blindfolded.</p>

        <div class="left-home-2">
            <p>Gibraltar is a gentle giant with a wild side. The son of two SARAS (Search and Rescue Association of Solace) volunteers, 
            he has always been skilled at getting others out of dangerous situations that are common in the Outlands. However, 
            he only began to understand the value of protecting others when he and his boyfriend stole his father’s motorcycle, 
            took it on a joyride, and got trapped by a deadly mudslide. His parents saved them, and his father lost an arm in the process. 
            Gibraltar has never forgotten that sacrifice and has devoted his life to helping those in need.</p>

            <p>Ajay Che, aka Lifeline, isn’t someone you would expect to find in the Adex Games. 
                The child of wealthy war profiteers, she left home when she learned of the damage her 
                family had caused and enlisted in the Frontier Corps, a humanitarian organization that aids 
                Frontier communities in need. She’s since devoted her life to helping others and joined the 
                Adex Games to fund the Frontier Corps with her winnings.</p>

    <h2>4. BLOODHOUND</h2>
    <div class="home-container-2">
        <div class="left-home-2">
            <p>Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen. 
                The child of two engineers stationed at the New Dawn industrial plant on Talos, Bloodhound was taken in 
                by their uncle Artur after a meltdown destroyed the facility and killed both their parents. 
                Artur taught them the Old Ways, a belief system that focuses on the glory of nature and rejects modern technology. 
                Yet Bloodhound was constantly drawn to technological marvels, and ultimately used both new and old methods to take down a 
                Goliath that preyed on the people of their village, forever changing their life’s path.</p>
